# 5. Where do I learn more?
Included in this repository is the TEL manual collection. This collection is divided into smaller, well specified Formative Educational Texts or FETs.
These are designed to be consistent and comprehensive, with a clear standard ensuring documentation quality.
They are also meant to be short and simple, yet comprehensive, and to give you a clear and logical foundation to use TEL in whatever
domain you see fit. There are 3 included in the manuals directory:
1. [FET-0](docs/fet-1.md): A manual for how FETs should be written and structured
1. FET-1: A user manual for those who wish to use the language
2. FET-2: A development standard for those who wish to join the development team and contribute
3. FET-3: A specification for those who aspire to implement the language, or one similar
