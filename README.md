# 1. Why TEL?
## 1.1 Values
prosocial, spreading knowledge
## 1.2 Intentions
creating something that can help people understand programming and how languages work
## 1.3 Criteria
what the language needs to be in order to fulfill those things

# 2. What is TEL?
> *"Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature,
but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary." â€” John N. Shutt*
## 2.1 models
everything is either a scalar or a list
models are placed in a context list for manipulation
## 2.2 messages
scalar messages are built ins, lists are user defined
messages have fields you fill out
## 2.3 modes

# 3. How do I use it?
## 3.1 Installation and configuration
## 3.2 Using TEL and designing software
## 3.3 Modifying TEL and contributing

# 4. Q & A

# 5. Where do I learn more?
Included in this repository is the TEL manual collection. This collection is divided into smaller, well specified *Formative Educational Texts* or FETs.
These are designed to be consistent and comprehensive, with a clear standard ensuring documentation quality.
They are also meant to be short and simple, yet comprehensive, and to give you a clear and logical foundation to use TEL in whatever
domain you see fit. There are 4 included in the [manuals](manuals) directory:
- [FET-0](manuals/fet-0.md): A manual for how FETs should be written and structured
- [FET-1](manuals/fet-1.md): A user manual for those who wish to use the language
- [FET-2](manuals/fet-2.md): A development standard for those who wish to join the development team and contribute
- [FET-3](manuals/fet-3.md): A specification for those who aspire to implement the language, or one similar
